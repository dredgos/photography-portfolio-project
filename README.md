# Photography portfolio project

A photography portfolio project built using HTML and CSS based on a design which was provided. 

Built following an atomic design process, building a pattern library of the individual elements which were then transferred into the main site build.

Designed with mobile in mind using media queries to display the content correctly at given screen sizes (780px, 500px).

CSS built in partials using variables and the BEM methodology to ensure the styling remains understandable and maintainable.
